# Welcome! 

Hey you! Thanks for visiting this very new place.  
This site launched just recently and a good amount of projects and general information are still missing. 

## About me

<!--- MMus - *Klang und Realität* - 1. semester - RSH Düsseldorf   --->
I'm David Hanraths, 33yo he/him, Germany/NRW based student of Music with an obsession on the aesthetic aspects of digital and acoustic spaces.  
With an emphasis on music informatics, I completed my bachelor's degree (BMus) in September 2022 at *Institute for Music and Media* in Düsseldorf, Germany.
