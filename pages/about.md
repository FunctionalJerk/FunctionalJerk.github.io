# Welcome! 

Hey you! Thanks for visiting this very new place.  
This site launched just recently and a good amount of projects and general information are still missing. 

## About me

I'm David, a Germany/NRW based student of Music with an obsession on the aesthetic aspects of digital and acoustic spaces.  
I have completed my bachelor's degree on 09/22 at *Institute for Music and Media* in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, 
emphasizing on music informatics -and production.

## Work

Please get in contact for inquiries regarding collaborations and jobs in:
- Music production 
- Sonic art in installation 
- Sonic art instrumentation
- Workshops and talks regarding:
	- Live-Coding (for kids)
	- SBC's and MC's in contexts of Art
	- SuperCollider 
	- (Academic) writing with Markdown, Pandoc and Zotero
	- Basics of in-the-box music production

I would also consider jobs in teaching or performing electric guitar. 
As this is not my main focus, you'd have to sell me on it ;)
