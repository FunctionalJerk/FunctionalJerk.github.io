# Welcome! 

Hey you! Thanks for visiting this very new place.  
This site is where I host demos and short descriptions of my works of art and artistic research.
Click through the [projects]({{ site.url }}) or scroll through [media]({{ site.url }}/media) to get an impression of my work.  

This site launched just recently and a good amount of content is still missing. 
I will update this page frequently by adding new projects and general info, so stay tuned!
