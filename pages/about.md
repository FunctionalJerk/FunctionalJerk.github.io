# About me

I am **David Hanraths**, musicologist from Germany/NRW.  

In 2015 I started studying at the *Institute for Music and Media* in DÃ¼sseldorf.  
Back then, I planned to become either a jazz guitarist or some kind of production engineer.  
Instead, I learned that my passion for sound is much more to be found in the many facets of *music informatics*. 
There I learned more about the sound space and my place in it than I could have ever imagined.  

I am strongly inspired by the great artists of *New Music*, *Music Concrete*, *Noise* and *Experimental*,  
as well as from research in *linguistics* and related fields - always guided by my unending curiosity for the sound that surrounds us in everyday life.  
Therefore, I am constantly searching, listening and learning.  

I completed my Bachelor's degree in September 2022. Since then, I have dedicated my resources to documenting my projects and breaking new ground. 
In April 2023, I started my Master's degree at the *Institute for Music and Media* and uploaded this portfolio.

I create sonic art, mainly with digital tools like algorithms and data-sets, aswell as analog audio gear.  
Most of my works have their origins in a question, the exploration of which is sonified in an experimental setup.
