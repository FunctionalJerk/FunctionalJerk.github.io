## About me

I'm **David Hanraths**, *he/him*, Germany/NRW based scholar of Music.  

When I was nine years old, I was introduced to the Guitar. I soon discovered the world of Guitar Pedals and fell in love with these mystical devices.  

In 2015 I started studying at *Institute for Music and Media* in DÃ¼sseldorf. At the time, I planned to become either a Jazz-Guitarist, or some kind of producing engineer.  
Instead I learned that my passion for sound was much more represented in the manifold facets of *Music Informatics*. 
There I was taught more about the sonic space and my place within it, than I could have ever anticipated.  

I am strongly inspired by the great artists of *new music*, *Musique concrete*, *noise* and *experimental*, 
aswell as by research in *linguistics* and related fields - 
always guided by my unending curiosity for the sounds that surround us in everyday life. 
Therefore I'm constantly searching, listening, learning and growing.  

In September 2022 I completed my bachelor's degree. Since then, I have dedicated my ressources to documenting my projects and forging new pathways. 
In April 2023, I started my graduate studies at *Institute for Music and Media* and uploaded this portfolio.



## Work

I make sonic art, mainly with digital tools like algorithms and data-sets, aswell as analog audio gear.  
Most of my work utilizes some form of unpredictability, like randomness, feedback and sensor data. The results have been called *erratic*, *punky* and *mesmerizing*.
