# Welcome! 

Hey you! Thanks for visiting this very new place. There's not much to find here yet, but I hope to grow this page into some sort of portfolio.

I'm David, a Germany/NRW based student of Music with an obsession on the aesthetic aspects of digital space. At Intitute for Music and Media Duesseldorf I started out as a Guitarist dreaming to expand into Music-production (forgive me, I was young). I did so and quickly learned that there's aspects of Music that fascinate me even more.

Long story short, I started dabbling in programming and digital Arts and now here I am trying to tell the World what I discovered.

Please get in contact and stay tuned for the actual content.
