# Welcome! 

Hey you! Thanks for visiting this very new place.  
This site is where I host demos and short descriptions of my works of art and artistic research.
Click through the [projects]({{ site.url }}) or scroll through [media]({{ site.url }}/media) to get an impression of my work.  

This site launched just recently and a good amount of content is still missing. 
I will update this page frequently by adding new projects and general info, so stay tuned! 

## About me

I'm David Hanraths, 33yo he/him, Germany/NRW based student of Music with an obsession on the aesthetic aspects of digital and acoustic spaces.  
With an emphasis on music informatics, I completed my bachelor's degree (BMus) in September 2022 at *Institute for Music and Media* in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.  

I make sonic art, mainly with digital tools like algorithms and data-sets, aswell as analog audio gear.  
Most of my work uses some form of chaos, like randomness, feedback and sensor data. Results span from *ambient* to *noise* and have been called *erratic*, *punky* and *mesmerizing*.  

I am strongly inspired by the artists of *new music*, of *noise* and of *experimental music*, but even more so by my own curiosity.
Therefore I'm constantly searching, learning and growing. Right now, I strive to get better at coding, academic research and electrical engineering.
