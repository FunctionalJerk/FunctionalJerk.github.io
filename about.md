# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Hey you! 
Thanks for visiting this very new place. 
There's not much to find here yet, but I hope to grow this page into some sort of portfolio.

I'm David, a Germany/NRW based student of Music with a weird fixation on the aesthetic aspects of digital space. 
At *Intitute for Music and Media Duesseldorf* I started out as a Guitarist dreaming to expand into Music-production (forgive me, I was young).
I did so and quickly learned that there's aspects of Music that fascinate me more. 

Long story short, I started dabbling in Programming and digital Arts and now here I am trying to tell the World what I discovered and what services I can provide. 

Please get in contact and stay tuned for the actual content.
