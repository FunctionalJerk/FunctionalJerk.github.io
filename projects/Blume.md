# Es Kann Nicht Alles Blume Sein

*Generative multichannel-installation,  
presented at [Palastrauschen](https://www.kunstpalast.de/palastrauschen) on Feb. 23, 2023.*  

**Lennart Posch** - *text and composition*  
**David Hanraths** - *arrangement and production*  

*Audio recording will be uploaded shortly!*

*We are caught in the eternal challenge to reconstruct intentions and create meaning from interaction.
Hiding among the melodies we speak or dream, the Nature of these intentions remains incomprehensable.*

This work explores the abstact ambiguity of parasemantic sign systems within the intersections of acousmatic and concrete sound.

It utilizes field-recordings, private voice messages sourced through the [signal-media-exporter](https://github.com/IdealChain/signal-media-exporter), 
aswell as original speech composed by Lennart Posch, that was performed by himself and Maral Sedighi.

To achieve this, I programmed a fixed form of generative parts within the SuperCollider programming language.
This Routine ran on a *Raspberry-Pi 4B* equipped with [Prynth](https://prynth.github.io/) and connected to a *RME Fireface UCX+*.

Please understand, that the source code and documentation to this project will not be released,
as it depends on very private audio material.
