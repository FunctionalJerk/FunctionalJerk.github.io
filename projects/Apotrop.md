*Generative 4-channel installation,*  
*preseted @ Art Artist Düsseldorf[^art] from March 31. until April 02. 2023* 

**Lennart Posch & David Hanraths** - *concept*  
**David Hanraths** - *production*  
**Sponsch**[^spo] - *Live-performance*  

This album documents an experiment in combining a controllable generative installation with live performances. 

The output of two DIY EMF-sensors was filtered through several controllable FFT filters and played from four speakers, that were aligned in a diamond-like shape. 

The installation was meant as a playable instrument. Artists would perform with it and inside it, by using the EMF-sensors and by adding their own musical setup.
Resulting audio is then fed into a loop, that echoes within the ongoing installation.
