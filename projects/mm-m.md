*3-piece EP, released September 14, 2022*  

**Jeff Burido** 	* - Drums*  
**Hügelmann** 		* - Zither* and *No-Input-Mixer*  
**David Hanraths**  	* - Synthesis, Composition, Production*  

Within my bachelor thesis, I have developed a concept for transcribing those speech melodies that occur within everyday human interaction.  

Harmony works different in verbal communication:  
It's meaning can only be understood within the context of the speakers vocal range. Hence, one intonation can mean different things, depending on who vocalises it.  
That's why my transcriptions don't use an absolute scale (Hz) but a relative one, stripped of the individual vocal range of its original speaker.  
One advantage of this approach is that it translates well onto the range of any other instrument or gradual parameter of music.  

I assumed that if intonation was a manifestation of analoguous communication, it's significance had to be found in its form.  

This EP documents my experiments with this idea.  
Each piece represents an attempt to reconcile human improvisation with algorithmic composition.  
For details on this EP, follow the bandcamp-link above and read up on the description given for the individual tracks.
