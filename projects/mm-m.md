*3-piece EP, released September 14, 2022*  

**Jeff Burido** 	* - Drums*  
**Hügelmann** 		* - Zither* and *No-Input-Mixer*  
**David Hanraths**  	* - Synthesis, Composition, Production*  

Within my bachelor thesis, I have developed a concept for transcribing those speech melodies that occur within everyday human interaction.  

Harmony works different in verbal communication:  
It's meaning can only be understood within the context of the speakers vocal range. Hence, one intonation can mean different things, depending on who vocalises it.  
That's why my transcriptions don't use an absolute scale (Hz) but a relative one, defined by the vocal range of it's speaker.  
One advantage of this approach is that it translates well onto any other gradual parameter of music.  

My idea was, that if intonation is a manifestation of analoguous communication, it's meaning (or significance) had to be inherent in their form.  
For details on the EP, follow the bandcamp-link above and read up on the description given for the individual tracks.  

This EP documents my experiments with this method.  
Each piece represents an attempt to reconcile human improvisation with algorithmic composition.
