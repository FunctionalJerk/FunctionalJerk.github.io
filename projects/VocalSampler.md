Samples within a library were analyzed and mapped by the tSNE algorithm. 
This produces a 2D-Scatterplot where each point represents a vocal-sample. 
These samples can now be sequenced and resynthesized live, through a gui that was programmed in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

In this project I aimed to connect the results of my artistic research on vocal melodies and mining audio-data and was part of my bachelor studies in *Music and Media* at *Robert-Schumann-Hochschule Düsseldorf*.  
For further information, please refer to this project's [GitHub-repostitory](https://github.com/FunctionalJerk/tSNE-VocalSampler).
